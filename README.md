Tools and instruction for how to mod Space Marine 2

First tool you need is [ImHex](https://github.com/WerWolv/ImHex). This allows you to make direct hexidecimal edits to Space Marine 2 pak files. 

When modding these files, you need to make sure that the byte size of the pak ends up being exactly the same as the original, with all files inside still showing a correct CRC-32 value. This is easier than it sounds.
